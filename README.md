## Introduction
> i used python to create 3 different algorithms we learned in class which were the closest point, Dijkstra, Intervel Sceduling algorhithms we learned in class.
>  With the knowledge learned from class i have been able to create 3 different algoriiths we have spent a lot of time talking about.
> with each one i was able to create a graphical representation so you can understand what each algorhthm can so

## Description
>when we run the Dijkstra algorithm we are able to see the step by step of how eaxh step works. For step 1 it first sets it to 0 as the vertex. it selects the vertex u that is not procesed and has a minimum dsistance from the original vertex. For each neighbor that has not beeen procesed it updates the distance to v as the minimum of its current distance to u plus the weight of the edge from U to V. it then marks u as procesd. We have to repeat these steps each time there is a new vertex.
>next we do the closest point algorithm. I drew the graph in a 2d plane using x and y. the algorithm first sorts the points by x cordinate and then it recursively devide the set of points into halves, it then finds the minimum distance in each half, and considers points close to the dividing line
>next we will run the interval scaduling time this algorhthm first sets them into plot to visualizeing their length and relationship.

## Requirements	
>  in order to run this programs you need to use python you will also need to downdload pip install matplotlib in the termianl.
